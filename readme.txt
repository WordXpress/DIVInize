== Description ==

= Divi Theme Enhancements Outside the Builder =

ET DIVInizer by [WordXpress](http://wordx.press/divi-support-maintenance/) makes the Divi by ElegantThemes theme better for bloggers and other users who don't use the Divi Builder on posts. It allows you to set options for all non-Divi Builder posts (and some for pages). This includes: related posts similar to Extra theme, an Author Box displaying the author's Gravatar and bio at the end of each post, removing the sidebar, and automatically using Divi's lightbox to display images, changing the archive pages to a Grid style, disable cropping of featured images, automatically display the current year in the footer, and more!

= ET DIVInizer's Story =

At **WordXpress** we support and maintain a lot of WordPress websites including *many* using the Divi theme. We love Divi! But for writing posts, the Divi Builder is way overkill for most blogging. If you're doing advanced, complex stories with lots of fancy formatting and interactive features, it's wonderful. Most of us just want to write, insert a few images and links, and publish!

I found the Expand Divi plugin and was very excited about what it could do for us. However, it had a few shortcomings, including using only tags to calculate related posts. We don't use tags on our blog, so the related posts didn't work! I reached out to the plugin's developer Faycal, and asked if we could fork his plugin and create our own version? He was very supportive, so we combined it with some other stuff we'd been working on and viola! ET DIVInizer was born, with category-based related posts, automatic lightboxing of images, and more.

If you're like us and want to "just write," we created ET DIVInizer for you. We don't use Divi Builder for posts, and neither do most of our [members](https://wordx.press/wp-support-plans/). So we created this plugin to make the Divi blog a little more blogger-firendly by bringing some much-needed features from Extra and elsewhere to Divi.

= Features =

* **Author Box** Add an about-author box below all posts with this setting.
* **Single Post Pagination** Add pagination to navigate between posts.
* **Related Posts** Encourage readers to stay by showing them other interesting content at the end of each post. Options to select related content based on tags or categories.
* **Post Tags** Display post tags in the post meta (Divi only shows categories by default), or at the bottom of posts.
* **Lightbox** Open images in the Divi lightbox, when links to images are clicked in posts and pages not using the Divi Builder.
* **Archive Blog Style** Change your index, categories, and all archive blog pages to grid layout.
* **Remove Sidebar** Remove of the sidebar globally, on archive, or single posts pages.
* **Recent Posts Widget** Show any amount of latest posts in the sidebar, custom post types are supported.
* **Twitter Feed Widget** Display any number of your latest tweets in your sidebar.
* **Footer Year Shortcode** Use the [year] shortcode under Theme Customizer > Footer > Bottom Bar > EDIT FOOTER CREDITS to display the current year. Year may not show in the Customizer preview.
* **Featured Image Cropping** Disable Divi's default Featured image cropping! Now your featured images won't get cropped if they're wider than what Divi prefers by default.

= Requirements =
